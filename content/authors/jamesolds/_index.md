My professional career began in 2009 when I enlisted in the US Navy as an Information Systems Technician, but I have been obsessed with computers ever since the day my parents brought home a our first computer, a Tandy. I have been lucky enough to be able to work on interesting projects with really smart people, picking up network engineering early on in my career. After separating from the Navy, I became very interested in automation and software development while working on my BS in Software Development and Security. Today I leverage my experience across a diverse range of industries and technologies to automate and abstract infrastructure.
