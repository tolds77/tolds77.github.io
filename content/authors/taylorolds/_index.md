After 4 years of being a student and a full time parent I am eager to step into the working world once again. I am a Navy Veteran with a background in Information System Technologies and customer service. During my military career I learned valuable leadership skills and gained extensive knowledge on troubleshooting, software, and hardware systems. While in the service I explored the world and got to experience many beautiful people, places and cultures. During my leave of absence from the workforce I found I thrived when given a creative task to accomplish, always wanting to make creative experiences for my friends and family to enjoy. I am currently studying to complete a double major in Digital Media & Web Technologies and Marketing. I am highly motivated and I know with my background and life experience I will make a great addition to any team.
