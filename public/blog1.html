        <h1>Creating a Magical Frozen-Inspired Birthday for Ada's 7th Birthday</h1>
        <p>For my daughter Adaâ€™s 7th birthday, we went all out with a <strong>Frozen-themed</strong> party featuring a custom balloon color palette, themed treats, and fun activities.</p>

        <h2>The Enchanting Balloon Display</h2>
        <p>We created a custom color palette for the balloon display, featuring icy blues, soft lavenders, and pearly whites to bring the Frozen magic to life.</p>
