            <p>Apollo absolutely loves <strong>Spider-Man</strong>. Since we recently redecorated his room with a custom Spider-Man mural, it only felt right to base his 5th birthday on what he loves the most—his boho Spider-Man room and his favorite superhero.</p>
            
            <h2>Custom Party Palette & Cake Design</h2>
            <p>I designed a custom color palette inspired by his room’s aesthetic and sent it to the cake designer. She captured my vision perfectly, creating a stunning, comic-inspired cake that tied in seamlessly with the decorations.</p>

            <h2>DIY Balloons & Decorations</h2>
            <p>I took charge of the balloon installations and party decorations to match the theme. The setup included a Spider-Man backdrop with cascading balloon garlands in deep reds, navy blues, and golden yellows.</p>

            <h2>Spider-Man Bounce House & A Rainy Day Celebration</h2>
            <p>Apollo had a Spider-Man bounce house at his party, and despite the pouring rain, he had the absolute best time celebrating with his friends. Rain or shine, the excitement never stopped!</p>
